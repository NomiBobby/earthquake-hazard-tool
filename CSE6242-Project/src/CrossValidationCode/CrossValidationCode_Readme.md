Description
-------------
This code package is designed to test different Machine Learning algorithms using k-fold cross validation. The Algorithm we have tested are Decision Tree, Neural Network, KNN with Ada boosting, SVM and Normal KNN. The results are shown in the the figure that Neural Network is the best result for our data.
